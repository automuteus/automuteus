AutoMuteUs is a Discord Bot to harness Among Us game data, and automatically mute/unmute players during games!

Requires [amonguscapture](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture) to capture and relay game data.

Have any questions, concerns, bug reports, or just want to chat? Join our discord at https://discord.gg/ZkqZSWF!

Click the "invite me" badge in the header to invite the bot to your server, or click the GIF on the left.

# ⚠️ Requirements ⚠️

1. You **must** run the [Capture application](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture/releases/latest) on your Windows PC for the bot to work! Any Among Us games that don't have a user running the capture software will **not have automuting capabilities**!
2. The [Capture application](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture/releases) currently only supports the **Non-Beta Official Steam** release of the game.

# Quickstart and Demo (click the image):

[![Quickstart](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kO4cqMKV2yI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kO4cqMKV2yI)

# Usage and Commands

To start a bot game in the current channel, type the following `.au` command in Discord after inviting the bot:

```
.au new
# Starts a game, and allows users to react to emojis to link to their in-game players
```

The bot will send you a private message (make sure your Discord settings allow DMs from server members!) with a link that is used to sync the capture software to your game. It will also have a link to download the latest version of the capture software, if you don't have it already.

If you want to view command usage or see the available options, type `.au` or `.au help` in your Discord channel.

## Commands

The Discord Bot uses the `.au` prefix for any commands

| Command        | Alias   | Arguments   | Description                                                                                                     | Example                            |

# Self-Hosting

If you would prefer to self-host the bot, the steps for doing so are provided below.
Self-hosting requires robust knowledge and troubleshooting capability for Docker/Docker-compose, unRAID, Heroku, and/or any other networking and routing config specific to your hosting solution.

As such, **we recommend that the majority of users take advantage of our Verified bot**. The link to invite our bot can be found here:

<a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=753795015830011944&permissions=267746384&scope=bot" alt="invite">
        <img alt="Invite Link" src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=bot&message=invite%20me&color=purple">
    </a>

If you are certain that you would prefer to self-host the bot, please follow any of the guides detailed below.

## Pre-Installation Steps, Important!

- Create an Application and Bot account (requires Admin privileges on the Server in question). [Instructions here](https://github.com/denverquane/amongusdiscord/blob/master/BOT_README.md)

Now follow any of the specific hosting options provided below:

## Docker Compose:

Docker compose is the simplest and recommended method for self-hosting AutoMuteUs, but it does require an existing physical machine or VPS to run on.

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file in this repository that will provide all the consituent components to run AutoMuteUs.

### Steps:

- Install Docker and Docker Compose on the machine you will be using to host AutoMuteUs
- Download the `docker-compose.yml` from this repository, and create a `.env` file in the same directory that will contain your Environment Variables. On Linux/UNIX systems you can use `touch .env` to create this file, but a template `sample.env` is provided in this repository for reference. 
- Provide your specific Environment Variables in the `.env` file, as relevant to your configuration. Please see the Environment Variables reference further down in this Readme for details, as well as the `sample.env` provided.
- Run `docker-compose pull`. This will download the latest built Docker images from Dockerhub that are required to run AutoMuteUs.
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all the containers required for AutoMuteUs to function. The containers will now be running in the background, but you can view the logs for the containers using `docker-compose logs`, or `docker-compose logs -f` to follow along as new log entries are generated.

## unRAID

unRAID hosting steps are are not yet updated for v3.0+ of AutoMuteUs, and as such is not supported at this time.

## Heroku

Heroku hosting steps are are not yet updated for v3.0+ of AutoMuteUs, and as such is not supported at this time.

## Environment Variables

### Required

- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: The Bot Token used by the bot to authenticate with Discord.
- `REDIS_ADDRESS`: The host and port at which your Redis database instance is accessible. Ex: `192.168.1.42:6379`

### Optional

- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_2`: A second Bot Token to be used to distribute the mute/deafen requests to Discord.
  If you play in larger groups of 8+ people, this is recommended to not be rate-limited (delayed) by Discord when rounds change!
- `EMOJI_GUILD_ID`: If your bot is a member of multiple guilds, this ID can be used to specify the single guild that it should use for emojis (no need to add the emojis to ALL servers).
- `PORT`: The **internal** port the Bot will use for incoming socket.io communications. Defaults to 8123.
- `HOST`: The **externally-accessible URL** for the discord bot. For example, `http://test.com:8123`.
  This is used to provide the linking URI to the capture, via the Direct Message the bot sends you when typing `.au new`.
  **You must specify `http://` or `https://` accordingly, and specify the port if non-8123. For example, `https://your-app.herokuapp.com:443`**
- `SERVICE_PORT`: Port used for graceful shutdowns and stats via HTTP GET. Defaults to 5000
- `CONFIG_PATH`: Alternate filesystem path for guild and user config files. Defaults to `./`
- `LOG_PATH`: Filesystem path for log files. Defaults to `./`
- `CAPTURE_TIMEOUT`: How many seconds of no capture events received before the Bot will terminate the associated game/connection. Defaults to 36000 seconds.
- `REDIS_PASS`: Your Redis database password, if necessary.

### HIGHLY advanced. Probably don't ever touch these!

- `NUM_SHARDS`: Num shards provided to the Discord API.
- `SHARD_ID`: Shard ID used to identify with the Discord API. Needs to be strictly less than `NUM_SHARDS`

# Similar Projects

- [Imposter](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Impostor): Similar bot that uses private Discord channels instead of mute/deafen. Also uses a dummy player joining the game and "spectating" to get game information; no capture needed (although loses the 10th player slot).

- [AmongUsBot](https://github.com/alpharaoh/AmongUsBot): Without their original Python program
  with a lot of the OCR/Discord functionality, I never would have even thought of this idea! **Not currently maintained**

- [amongcord](https://github.com/pedrofracassi/amongcord): A great program for tracking player status and auto mute/unmute in Among Us.
  Their project works like a traditional Discord bot; very easy installation!

- [Silence Among Us](https://github.com/tanndev/silence-among-us#silence-among-us): Another bot quite similar to this one, which also uses AmongUsCapture. Now in early-access with a publicly-hosted instance!

# Troubleshooting

- **"Websocket 400-something: Authentication Failed" Error!**
  Your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is incorrect or invalid. Make sure you copied/pasted the Bot _token_, NOT the "client secret" from the Discord Developer portal

- **"Emoji ID is not a snowflake" Error! Or the bot doesn't provide emojis as reactions on the status message!**
  The discord API is agonizingly slow to upload new emojis, inform bots about the presence of new/updated emojis, and delete emojis.
  The easiest answer is to **give it a while** (sometimes can take almost 30 minutes), and try again.
