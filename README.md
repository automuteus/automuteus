# AmongUsAutoMute (BETA) 

Discord Bot to scrape Among Us on-screen data, and automatically mute/unmute players during the course of the game!

Works in conjunction with [amonguscapture](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture)

**This program is in Beta. While we are confident about the basic functionality, there will still be issues or pecularities with how the program functions! We are actively working to resolve these issues!**

Have any questions, concerns, bug reports, or just want to chat? Join the discord at https://discord.gg/ZkqZSWF!

# Requirements

1. This program must be run on a Windows PC. The program **CANNOT** be run directly on mobile phones.
2. You need a minimum of 12 open emoji slots on your server. The bot uses player emojis to link discord users to in-game player colors; it will add them automatically, but you need at least 12 slots (25 recommended).
3. You must run the discord bot, and the capture portion (See Easiest installation below) at the same time, and on the same PC (for now).

# Installation

If you followed all the steps in the video above, you're done with the installation and can start using the bot, or see the
Usage/Commands sections below! If you prefer text instructions over videos, follow all the instructions below instead.

## Pre-Installation Steps, Important!!!
1. Create an Application and Bot account for your Discord Server (requires Admin privileges on the Server in question).
    - Follow the instructions [HERE](https://github.com/denverquane/amongusdiscord/blob/master/BOT_README.md)

Now follow either the `Easiest` install, or the `Install From Source`:

## Easiest:
1. [Download the latest release executable (`.exe`) and `final.txt`](https://github.com/denverquane/amongusdiscord/releases) for this discord bot.
2. Paste the Bot Token you obtained in the pre-installation into the `final.txt` file, after the `=` sign.
3. Run the executable from step 1, either by double-clicking or using `./amongusdiscord.exe` in a terminal window.
4. [Download the latest `amonguscapture.exe`](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture/releases). If you are running the Discord bot remotely,
you can add a `host.txt` file in the same folder with the contents `http://<host>:<port>` to point to that instance, but this is totally optional.
5. **If Among Us is already running,** then start the capture executable you downloaded in the previous step. Otherwise, start the game and **then** start the capture.

Congrats, if you followed the instructions correctly, the bot should now be running! See the Sample Usage section below for details.

## Install From Source:
1. [Install Go 1.15.2](https://golang.org/dl/go1.15.2.windows-amd64.msi), but any version of Go 1.12+ should work.
2. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/denverquane/amongusdiscord`.
3. Navigate to the directory with `cd amongusdiscord`, and then build the executable using `go build -o amongusdiscord.exe main.go`.
4. Proceed to steps 2-3 of the `Easiest` install section above.

## Docker
You can also run the discord portion using docker if you prefer, it simply needs the port `8123` exposed, and you should provide your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` as an env variable.
Example:
`docker run -p 8123:8123 -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=<YourTokenHere> denverquane/amongusdiscord`

# Sample Usage
To start the bot in the current channel, type the following `.au` commands in Discord:
```
.au new ABCD eu
# Starts a game, and allows users to add emojis to link to their in-game players

.au t <voice channel name> 
# (Optional) This specifically marks the channel you want users automute within. Users in other voice channels will be ignored.
```
Get Playing!

If you need to add more players to the tracking list, they can be added using the reaction emojis once back in the lobby. Or, manually using `.au link @player color`. If all else fails, you can start a new game with `.au new`.

# Bot Commands

- [AmongUsBot](https://github.com/alpharaoh/AmongUsBot). Without their original Python program
with a lot of the OCR/Discord functionality, I never would have even thought of this idea! Not currently maintained

- [amongcord](https://github.com/pedrofracassi) great program for tracking player status and auto mute/unmute in Among Us.
Their project works like a traditional Discord bot; very easy installation!
