AutoMuteUs is a Discord Bot to harness Among Us game data, and automatically mute/unmute players during games!

Requires [amonguscapture](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture) to capture and relay game data.

Have any questions, concerns, bug reports, or just want to chat? Join our discord at https://discord.gg/ZkqZSWF!

Click the "invite me" badge in the header to invite the bot to your server, or click the GIF on the left.

All artwork for the bot has been generously provided by <a href=https://aspen-cyborg.tumblr.com/>Smiles</a>!

# ⚠️ Requirements ⚠️

1. You **must** run the [Capture application](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture/releases/latest) on your Windows PC for the bot to work! Any Among Us games that don't have a user running the capture software will **not have automuting capabilities**!
2. The [Capture application](https://github.com/denverquane/amonguscapture/releases) currently only supports the **Non-Beta Official Steam** release of the game.

# Quickstart and Demo (click the image):

[![Quickstart](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kO4cqMKV2yI/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/kO4cqMKV2yI)

# Usage and Commands

To start a bot game in the current channel, type the following `.au` command in Discord after inviting the bot:

```
.au new
# Starts a game, and allows users to react to emojis to link to their in-game players
```

The bot will send you a private message (make sure your Discord settings allow DMs from server members!) with a link that is used to sync the capture software to your game. It will also have a link to download the latest version of the capture software, if you don't have it already.

If you want to view command usage or see the available options, type `.au` or `.au help` in your Discord channel.

## Commands

The Discord Bot uses the `.au` prefix for any commands

# Self-Hosting

If you would prefer to self-host the bot, the steps for doing so are provided below.
Self-hosting requires robust knowledge and troubleshooting capability for Docker/Docker-compose, unRAID, Heroku, and/or any other networking and routing config specific to your hosting solution.

As such, **we recommend that the majority of users take advantage of our Verified bot**. The link to invite our bot can be found here:

<a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=753795015830011944&permissions=267746384&scope=bot" alt="invite">
        <img alt="Invite Link" src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=bot&message=invite%20me&color=purple">
    </a>

If you are certain that you would prefer to self-host the bot, please follow any of the guides detailed below.

## Pre-Installation Steps, Important!

- Create an Application and Bot account (requires Admin privileges on the Server in question). [Instructions here](https://github.com/denverquane/amongusdiscord/blob/master/BOT_README.md)

Now follow any of the specific hosting options provided below:

## Docker Compose:

Docker compose is the simplest and recommended method for self-hosting AutoMuteUs, but it does require an existing physical machine or VPS to run on.

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file in this repository that will provide all the constituent components to run AutoMuteUs.

### Steps:

- Install Docker and Docker Compose on the machine you will be using to host AutoMuteUs
- Download the `docker-compose.yml` from this repository, and create a `.env` file in the same directory that will contain your Environment Variables. On Linux/UNIX systems you can use `touch .env` to create this file, but a template `sample.env` is provided in this repository for reference. 
- Provide your specific Environment Variables in the `.env` file, as relevant to your configuration. Please see the Environment Variables reference further down in this Readme for details, as well as the `sample.env` provided.
- Run `docker-compose pull`. This will download the latest built Docker images from Dockerhub that are required to run AutoMuteUs.
- Run `docker-compose up -d` to start all the containers required for AutoMuteUs to function. The containers will now be running in the background, but you can view the logs for the containers using `docker-compose logs`, or `docker-compose logs -f` to follow along as new log entries are generated.

## unRAID

unRAID hosting steps are are not yet updated for v3.0+ of AutoMuteUs, and as such is not supported at this time.

## Heroku

Heroku hosting steps are are not yet updated for v3.0+ of AutoMuteUs, and as such is not supported at this time.

## Environment Variables

### Required

- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: The Bot Token used by the bot to authenticate with Discord.
- `REDIS_ADDR`: The host and port at which your Redis database instance is accessible. Ex: `192.168.1.42:6379`
- `POSTGRES_ADDR`: Address (host:port) at which Postgres is accessible. Used by automuteus to store game statistics.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: Username for authentication with Postgres.
- `POSTGRES_PASS`: Password for authentication with Postgres.

### Optional

- **DEPRECATED** `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_2`: A second Bot Token to be used to distribute the mute/deafen requests to Discord.
  **Use the new `WORKER_BOT_TOKENS` variable below, instead!**
- `WORKER_BOT_TOKENS`: A comma-separated list of extra tokens to be used for mute/deafen.
- `EMOJI_GUILD_ID`: If your bot is a member of multiple guilds, this ID can be used to specify the single guild that it should use for emojis (no need to add the emojis to ALL servers).
- `HOST`: The **externally-accessible URL** for Galactus. For example, `http://test.com:8123`.
  This is used to provide the linking URI to the capture, via the Direct Message the bot sends you when typing `.au new`.
  **You must specify `http://` or `https://` accordingly, and specify the port if non-8123. For example, `https://your-app.herokuapp.com:443`**
- `LOCALE_PATH`: Path to localization files.
- `LOG_PATH`: Filesystem path for log files. Defaults to `./`
- `CAPTURE_TIMEOUT`: How many seconds of no capture events received before the Bot will terminate the associated game/connection. Defaults to 36000 seconds.
- `REDIS_PASS`: Your Redis database password, if necessary.
- `AUTOMUTEUS_LISTENING`: What the bot displays it is "Listening to" in the online presence message. Recommend putting your custom command prefix here

### HIGHLY advanced. Probably don't ever touch these!

- `NUM_SHARDS`: Num shards provided to the Discord API.
- `SHARD_ID`: Shard ID used to identify with the Discord API. Needs to be strictly less than `NUM_SHARDS`

# Similar Projects

- [Imposter](https://github.com/molenzwiebel/Impostor): Similar bot that uses private Discord channels instead of mute/deafen. Also uses a dummy player joining the game and "spectating" to get game information; no capture needed (although loses the 10th player slot).

- [AmongUsBot](https://github.com/alpharaoh/AmongUsBot): Without their original Python program
  with a lot of the OCR/Discord functionality, I never would have even thought of this idea! **Not currently maintained**

- [amongcord](https://github.com/pedrofracassi/amongcord): A great program for tracking player status and auto mute/unmute in Among Us.
  Their project works like a traditional Discord bot; very easy installation!

- [Silence Among Us](https://github.com/tanndev/silence-among-us#silence-among-us): Another bot quite similar to this one, which also uses AmongUsCapture. Now in early-access with a publicly-hosted instance!

# Troubleshooting

- **"Websocket 400-something: Authentication Failed" Error!**
  Your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is incorrect or invalid. Make sure you copied/pasted the Bot _token_, NOT the "client secret" from the Discord Developer portal

- **"Emoji ID is not a snowflake" Error! Or the bot doesn't provide emojis as reactions on the status message!**
  The discord API is agonizingly slow to upload new emojis, inform bots about the presence of new/updated emojis, and delete emojis.
  The easiest answer is to **give it a while** (sometimes can take almost 30 minutes), and try again.
