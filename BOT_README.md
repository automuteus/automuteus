1. Navigate to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create New Application (top right). Name it whatever you like.

2. Click "Bot" on the left panel, then click the button on the right to Add Bot.

3. Scroll up to where the Bot Icon is displayed. **Copy the `Token` on the right, and paste it to a safe location.** We will need it later in the installation steps; this is the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in the `final.txt` file.

4. On the left panel, click "OAuth2", and then check the box marked `bot` under `Scopes`. Then scroll down to `Bot Permissions`, and check the box marked `Administrator` in the future, we will refine the permissions, but for now it is easiest with Admin permissions.

5. Scroll back up to `Scopes`, and copy the URL in the field that begins with `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?`. Paste this in a new browser tab, and grant the App access to whatever server you wish it to access. Close this tab when Finalized.
